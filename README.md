# Firefox extension for quickly getting pagecounts on Goodreads
Adds a button next to every book in search results which returns the page count for that specific button when pressed. 

This is how it looks

It only sends an request upon pressing the button, so there is a small delay until the pages are fetched. This way you won't be making a lot of requests to Goodreads, only for the ones when you would otherwise have manually checked.
